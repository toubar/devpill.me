As most of the web3/crypto culture resides on Twitter, it is a natural place for developers, founders, creators and users to hangout together. The more value you provide to the community, the more following you&amp;rsquo;ll get, therefore the more outreach as a developer. All teams are thirsty for good developers and so the more relevant followers you have, the more chances you&amp;rsquo;ll get of being discovered by a team looking to hire a blockchain developer in your field of expertise.</description></item></channel></rss>
